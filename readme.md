#CS6251-Midterm-Porfolio-Matthew Heering
In this submission I utlized google fonts and remixicon.

###Remixicon
This tool provided standardized SVG files, and a link to implement them if I didn't have the file. 
      <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/remixicon@2.2.0/fonts/remixicon.css" rel="stylesheet">
This is the link I used for an external stylsheet.  But most of them I downloaded directly and implemented them with an image tag.

###Google fonts
      @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Playfair+Display&family=Rubik&display=swap');
This import statment gave me access to use a font of theirs.  I chose this method because I thought it looked cleaner than the link method in the html. 

###CSS variables
I declared several css variable to set a color scheme.  I used a color scheme generator to find the colors for a monochromatic color scheme.  I chose this scheme becuase it allowed my images to pop better against the background.  
      :root {
      --black: #192129;
      --darkGreen: rgb(49, 73, 79);
      --lightGreen: rgb(95, 112, 131);
      --white: #fefefe;
      }
